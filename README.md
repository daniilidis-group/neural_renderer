# Neural 3D Mesh Renderer

This repo contains a PyTorch implementation of the paper [Neural 3D Mesh Renderer](http://hiroharu-kato.com/projects_en/neural_renderer.html) by Hiroharu Kato, Yoshitaka Ushiku, and Tatsuya Harada.
The renderer is modified from [neural-render](https://github.com/daniilidis-group/neural_renderer) which fits for latest PyTorch with version higher than 1.6.

The library is fully functional and it passes all the test cases supplied by the authors of the original library.
Detailed documentation will be added in the near future.

## Requirements
PyTorch 1.6.0+. Currently the library has both Python 3 and Python 2 support.

**Note**: In some newer PyTorch versions you might see some compilation errors involving AT_ASSERT. In these cases you can use the version of the code that is in the branch *at_assert_fix*. These changes will be merged into master in the near future.
## Installation
You can install the package by running
```
pip3 install neural_renderer_pytorch
```
Since running install.py requires PyTorch, make sure to install PyTorch before running the above command.
## Running examples
```
python ./examples/example1.py
python ./examples/example2.py
python ./examples/example3.py
python ./examples/example4.py
```


## Example 1: Drawing an object from multiple viewpoints

## Example 2: Optimizing vertices

Transforming the silhouette of a teapot into a rectangle. The loss function is the difference between the rendered image and the reference image.

Reference image, optimization, and the result.

## Example 3: Optimizing textures

Matching the color of a teapot with a reference image.

Reference image, result.

## Example 4: Finding camera parameters

The derivative of images with respect to camera pose can be computed through this renderer. In this example the position of the camera is optimized by gradient descent.
